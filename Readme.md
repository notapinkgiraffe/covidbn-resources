   - Comply to all the directives from the Ministry of Health and ensure easy contact at any time. Patients who fail or defy in complying with this Home Isolation Policy may be subject to a compound fine of up to BND5,000, under the Infectious Diseases Act (Chapter 204).
- Any patients who feel their symptoms worsen while in isolation at home should call the 991 Ambulance Emergency Line immediately so that they can be given treatment as soon as possible.
- However, patients in Category 1 and Category 2a who are found to be more suitable to undergo treatment in isolation centres for certain reasons, they will be immediately transferred to those centres. This is to ensure they will be able to be given immediate treatment if their condition worsens. Therefore, anyone who is currently in isolation centres is advised to be patient and continue to be monitored at those centres.
