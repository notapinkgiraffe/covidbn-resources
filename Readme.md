- Stay-at-home period will be shortened to 10.00 p.m. to 4.00 a.m
- As a safety precaution, the plan for the reopening of premises also warrants the need to ensure that all SOPs continue to be in place, such as physical distancing, venue capacity limits, the wearing of facemasks, maintaining cleanliness, and BruHealth mobile application use. Meanwhile the use of ART prior to entering premises is encouraged. Aside from these the Government will continue to formulate contingency plans in case of any unwanted eventualities in the future.
- During the Transition Phase, security and enforcement agencies will continue to monitor any incidents of violation of the directives or the Standard Operating Procedures ‚Äì SOPs; to ensure the safety and the well-being of the public. In addition, members of the public can contact the National Coordination Centre for COVID-19, which operates 24 hours a day, for any complaints of violations of the guidelines. The hotline numbers that can be contacted are:

### Details of Transition Phase

The respective managements are also required to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated, as follows:

   - Updating the list of workers in the BruHealth application and ensuring that their workers have completed their vaccinations;
   - Premises are required to register their respective QR codes in the BruHealth application and their respective capacities - premises are not allowed to accept customers beyond 50% of their capacity;
   - The owners of premises must ensure that all individuals who enter their premises scan their BruHealth application upon entering (including all staff/personnel/volunteers);
   - The owners of premises are to ensure that only individuals with green and yellow BruHealth codes are allowed to enter;
   - The owners of premises need to ensure that all workers/staff/volunteers that are eligible to be vaccinated have been fully vaccinated;
   - The use of facemasks (except when eating or drinking), physical distancing of at least 1.5 metres, self-health monitoring and occasional ART testing, as well as ensuring that premises have adequate ventilation.

- Gatherings at private homes during this phase are permitted for individuals who have completed their vaccinations, and are limited to 10 to 30 persons only (depending on the size of the home);
- The reopening of some of the schools for individuals that have completed their vaccinations, and conducting of Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) at regular intervals ‚Äì

- Individuals who are medically exempted from receiving vaccinations are not permitted to enter the aforementioned premises.
- The mandatory vaccination requirement is extended to the teaching workforce, non-teaching school staff, staff and guardians at schools and children‚Äôs daycare centres, trainers and so on. However, those with health conditions such as allergies will be exempted from this requirement, that is, based on the health certification provided.
- Meanwhile, planning and preparations for the reopening of schools are still under way, considering that fact the National Vaccination Programme is still being carried out for individuals aged from 12 to 17 years and children below 12 years of age have yet to be vaccinated. Procedures for the reopening of schools, and that children‚Äôs daycare centres and other learning institutions will be announced at a later date, that is, as soon as the COVID-19 Steering Committee has completed its review of the plans; and

- Commencing Friday, 8 October 2021, the Home Isolation Policy for COVID-19 patients is introduced
- Patients who are identified as under Category 1, that is, patients which do not have any symptoms and Category 2a, that is, patients who have only mild symptoms; to undergo self-isolation at home only after obtaining assessment and confirmation from the Ministry of Health
- Each COVID-19 patient managed under this policy will be required to undergo the following:
   - Monitored by the Patient Management Team, Ministry of Health throughout the 14-day self-isolation;
   - Mandatory to wear a red wristband for the purpose of identifying COVID-19 patients until the end of the isolation period; and
   - Comply to all the directives from the Ministry of Health and ensure easy contact at any time. Patients who fail or defy in complying with this Home Isolation Policy may be subject to a compound fine of up to BND5,000, under the Infectious Diseases Act (Chapter 204).
- Any patients who feel their symptoms worsen while in isolation at home should call the 991 Ambulance Emergency Line immediately so that they can be given treatment as soon as possible.
- However, patients in Category 1 and Category 2a who are found to be more suitable to undergo treatment in isolation centres for certain reasons, they will be immediately transferred to those centres. This is to ensure they will be able to be given immediate treatment if their condition worsens. Therefore, anyone who is currently in isolation centres is advised to be patient and continue to be monitored at those centres.
